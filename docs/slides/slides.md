Note: Meteor enables us to quickly develop any application at a rapid pase.
Not only is it blazing fast to develop an application in. At runtime you'll be amazed by its speed. Due to its full-stack reactivity.
An event on any client will tangle into all the other clients if needed.
And best of all it's all in one language.
But since this is a workshop i wont be going into the gruesome detail of the framework itself we are going to build something!
